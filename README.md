# Neural State Decoding with PCA (Haxby Dataset)

This project applies PCA to fMRI data from the Haxby dataset to explore how
neural activity in the ventral temporal cortex separates face and house stimuli.

## Methods
- Dataset: Haxby et al. (2001)
- Region of interest: Ventral Temporal Cortex (VT)
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA (2 components)
- Visualisation: PC1 vs PC2

## Key Result
Face and house stimuli show partial separation in low-dimensional neural space,
consistent with category-selective representations in VT cortex.

## Why this project
Built as a first exploratory neuroimaging + machine learning project while
learning Python and neuroimaging workflows.
